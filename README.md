Welcome to my **Scientific Computing with Python** repository! This is where I document my progress through FreeCodeCamp's [Scientific Computing with Python](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/) course. I'll be storing all my code, notes, and projects here as I work through the curriculum.

## About This Repository

This repository is my personal workspace for learning Python through FreeCodeCamp's **Scientific Computing with Python** course. The course covers:
- **Python Basics**: Variables, loops, functions, etc.
- **Data Structures**: Lists, tuples, dictionaries, etc.
- **Algorithms**: Sorting, searching, recursion, etc.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Classes, objects, inheritance, etc.
- **Scientific Libraries**: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, etc.

I'm using this repo to:
1. Store all my code and projects.
2. Take notes on what I learn.
3. Track my progress through the course.
4. Prepare for the certification projects.

## How I'm Using This Repo

1. **Cloning the Repository**:
   I cloned this repo to my local machine using:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/scientific-computing-with-python.git 

2. **Installing Dependencies**:
   I installed the required Python libraries using: 
   ```bash 
   pip install -r requirements.txt 

3. **Organizing My Work**: 
   - Each course module has its own folder in the ```ccourses/``` directory.
   - Certification projects are stored in the ```ccertification_projects/``` folder.
   - I take notes in the notes/ folder and store additional resources in ```resources/```.

4. **Tracking My Progress**:
   I update the My Progress Tracker section below as I complete modules and projects
